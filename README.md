# LLM_Inheritance

This project explores how object-oriented programming principles, especially inheritance, can be applied to the architecture of Large Language Models (LLMs).

Key Highlights:

1. Designed a modular LLM architecture using PyTorch and inheritance patterns

2. Implemented core components like multi-head attention, feed-forward networks, and transformer layers

3. Built progressive LLM classes: BaseLLM, StandardLLM, EnhancedLLM, SpecializedLLM, and AdvancedLLM

4. Used mixins (FactualityMixin, RefinementMixin) to flexibly add capabilities like factual checks and output refinement

5. Demonstrated clean usage of single and multiple inheritance

6. Ensured each subclass extends and enhances the parent classâ€™s functionality

Tech Stack: Python, PyTorch, OOP, Transformers

Next Steps:
Currently working on developing an LLM Interface for smoother interaction and visualization. Also planning to extend the system with multilingual support, tokenization, and training pipelines.
